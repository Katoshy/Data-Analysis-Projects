# Data-Analysis-Projects
There are 7 projects that demonstrate how to use various tools and libraries for data analysis.


**Project #1**

Trying out the numpy and pandas libraries

**Project #1**

Trying out the numpy and pandas libraries

**Project #2** 👶

Research on the weight of newborn babies based on their personal and family parameters.
Search for patterns (correlations) and hypotheses about the dependence of certain characteristics on others.

**Project #3** 👶`

In this project, I cleaned the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability for analysis. 
I identified and corrected issues such as formatting errors, duplicates, damages, inaccuracies, incompleteness, and outdated information.

**Project #4**💎

This Colab notebook analyzes a dataset of diamond prices and characteristics. 
The notebook imports the dataset and uses various visualization techniques to explore the data, including count plots, bar plots, histograms, box plots, 
and scatter plots. Additionally, the notebook calculates the correlation coefficient between the depth and size ("z") columns of the dataset. 
This analysis can help to identify trends and patterns in diamond prices and characteristics.

**Project #5** 🥶☁🌡🥵

This Colab notebook processes and analyzes a dataset of weather data. The notebook imports the dataset from an Excel file, 
cleans and processes the data, and performs various analysis tasks. The data cleaning process involves dropping duplicates, 
replacing empty values with 0, converting data types to the appropriate format, and renaming columns. 
The analysis tasks include sorting data based on specific conditions and generating a descriptive statistics summary of the dataset. 
The notebook also creates a pivot table to show wind speed values across different dates.
Overall, this notebook can help to identify patterns and trends in weather data, and can be useful for research or analysis purposes.

**Project #6** 🐱‍👤

This code imports necessary libraries and uses the pandas library to read a crime dataset in CSV format. 
It selects a few independent features and a dependent feature, 
and splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
Next, it creates an instance of a LinearRegression model and fits it to the training data. 
It then makes predictions on the test data and calculates various regression metrics 
such as R^2, explained variance score, mean squared error, mean absolute error, and correlation coefficient.
It also visualizes the residuals of the predictions and plots the original vs predicted values.
Finally, the code uses scikit-learn's KMeans clustering algorithm to cluster the data into 8 clusters and evaluates the performance of the clustering using silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin score, and Calinski-Harabasz score.

**Project #7** 🐹
This is a Python script for analyzing the possum dataset using various machine learning models 
such as logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine. 
The script loads the dataset using Pandas and performs exploratory data analysis. 
It then preprocesses the data, splits it into training and test sets, and trains various models to predict whether a possum 
is male or female based on its physical characteristics. Finally, it evaluates the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The script also includes feature selection using variance threshold. 
The models are implemented using scikit-learn library and the results are visualized using seaborn library.
